# 👋 Hey, I’m David.

I’m a software developer building **clean, fast, and reliable web experiences**. I work primarily with **JavaScript and React**, and I care about writing code that survives real-world use.

I focus on outcomes over tools. I learn fast, adapt quickly, and ship.

I care about:
- Production-quality code
- Simple, intentional user interfaces
- Strong developer workflows (including modern tooling)
- Constantly sharpening my technical edge

If it solves the problem, I’ll use it.

I type at **100+ WPM** — because speed compounds when you live in the terminal.
